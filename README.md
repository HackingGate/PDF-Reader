## Interface Localization

The app interface is localized in different Asian languages.

- Simplified Chinese (China)
- Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)
- Traditional Vernacular Written Cantonese (Hong Kong)
- Standard Japanese (Japan)
- Korean (South Korea)

In case if you don't know what Vernacular Cantonese is. See this Reddit comment.  
https://reddit.com/r/Cantonese/s/. 

Traditional Chinese used in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are different.  
(e.g. USB flash drive is "U盤", "USB手指", and "隨身碟" in different Traditional Chinese languages.)  
And Vernacular Written Cantonese is different from Standard Written Chinese in Hong Kong.  

The goal of this app is trying to provide a localized experience as much as possible. (EXPERIMENT)
